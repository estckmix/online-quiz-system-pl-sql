# online-quiz-system-pl-sql
PL/SQL code to create an online quiz system, including the necessary database schema, quiz creation, user registration, and score tracking. Each part is explained using comments.
Explanation

    Schema Design: Defines the structure of the database with tables for users, quizzes, questions, answers, responses, and scores.
    Procedures: Implements functionality for user registration, quiz creation, adding questions/answers, recording responses, and calculating scores.
    Testing: Demonstrates how to use the procedures with sample data.

This system is modular and can be extended with additional features such as time limits for quizzes, difficulty levels, or detailed reports.
